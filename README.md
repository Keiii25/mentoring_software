# mentoring_software
A software that allows students to look for tutors or be the tutors themselves and for tutors look for students.
Students are able to publish bids containing informations such as subject, cost, timing and preferred experience level of the tutors. Interested tutors can buy out the bid or make offer on the bid.

Note: This software is connected to a private REST API. The software requires a private API key to access the API. The API Key is not included in the project due to security reasons.
